If you are tired of playing the vanilla version of Minecraft on your server and want to try something new, consider installing custom Minecraft mods. These will significantly enhance your Minecraft gameplay experience and bring something completely new and unique, sometimes rather strange but nonetheless entertaining.

This tutorial will show you how to install the Forge Mod Manager and upload mods on an already existing Window. We will also cover the differences between Minecraft Forge and other mod launchers to help you decide whatâ€™s more fitting for you.

While vanilla Minecraft can be a lot of fun on its own, adding mods is one of the many ways to spice up gameplay. From interesting items to entirely new dimensions, mods have near-unlimited potential. Whether you want to team up on a server or explore alone in singleplayer, mods will need to be installed on your own computer as well. This is not as simple as simply pasting some mod files, however, as you will also need to have Minecraft Forge installed. This may become confusing for unfamiliar players, as there are multiple launchers and methods used to run mods. To remedy this, we have created tutorial to guide you through the installation process.

In essence, mods are user-made modifications to an original game. Usually, Minecraft mods include new items, blocks, resource packs, interface changes, and overall quality-of-life improvements for players.

The main charm of custom mods is the ability to change pretty much anything, making the whole Minecraft experience unique and personalized. However, itâ€™s worth mentioning that each mod needs to be downloaded and installed on both the server and client to work correctly.

Before we go any further, make sure you have set up a Minecraft server (Java Edition) and installed the Java Development Kit (JDK). However, there are some other factors to consider before installing Minecraft Forge or adding mods in general:

Most Minecraft servers run on the Java Edition of the game. Unfortunately, the Bedrock Edition doesnâ€™t support mods and only works with add-ons from the official Mojang Studios Minecraft Marketplace.
    
Each mod will significantly increase server RAM usage, so make sure that your hardware is able to handle it.
    
Back up your server files before installing any mods to have a clean restoration point in case something goes wrong.

You will need to stop the server to install any new mods. The installation process might still be successful if the server is running, but any changes will only appear after restarting it.

Arguably, the most popular modding add-on today is Minecraft Forge. It allows players to install and manage custom mods on the Java Edition of Minecraft.

Check the following steps to install Minecraft Forge on a Windows Minecraft server. Note that the installation process will be similar for Linux and macOS users.

 The next step finally involves downloading actual Minecraft mods.  There are hundreds, if not thousands, of different mods to choose from.
